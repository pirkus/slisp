# Lisp to Machine Code Compiler Plan

## Project Snapshot
- **Execution modes:** Tree-walking interpreter plus native compiler that powers a JIT-backed REPL and ELF AOT builds.
- **Language surface:** Numbers, strings, arithmetic/logic/comparison, `if`, `let`, `def`/`defn`, anonymous `fn`, closures, and string helpers (`str`, `count`, `get`, `subs`).
- **Runtime & tooling:** Heap allocator with scoped freeing, runtime support crate, unified CLI/REPL, and CircleCI coverage for parser/evaluator/compiler tests.

## Support Matrix
### Interpreter (`cargo run`)
- Fully supports core language features, lexical scoping, closures, and string operations.
- Rich diagnostics for arity/type errors and malformed syntax.

### Compiler (`slisp --compile`)
- REPL uses the native compiler pipeline to JIT machine code while preserving interpreter semantics.
- AOT pipeline emits ELF executables with automatic `-main` discovery and runtime linkage.
- Handles arithmetic/logic/comparison, conditionals, `let`, functions, heap-managed strings, and scoped frees.

## Phase Overview
The roadmap is organised as multi-phase efforts. Completed phases are retained for context; active phases highlight remaining work.

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Evaluator & Compiler ‚úÖ
- Implemented AST parser, domain model, evaluator with lexical environments, and initial stack-oriented IR.
- Added CLI/REPL, interpreter error handling, and baseline machine-code emission for expressions.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Stack-Based Compilation ‚úÖ
- Migrated codegen to true stack evaluation enabling multi-operand and nested expressions.
- Brought compiler feature parity for arithmetic, comparisons, logic, and `if` expressions.

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced Language Features ‚úÖ
- Delivered `def`/`defn`, anonymous `fn`, closures, and function invocation in interpreter mode.
- Established persistent environments and comprehensive function arity/type validation.

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Function Compilation Architecture ‚úÖ
- Extended parser and IR for multi-expression programs and function metadata.
- Implemented System V ABI-compliant call frames, multi-function codegen, and ELF entry stubs.
- Verified via `tests/programs/functions/*` covering nested calls and parameter passing.

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Code Quality & Refactoring ‚úÖ
- Modularised crate layout (compiler, codegen, evaluator, repl, cli) with no functional regressions.
- Expanded automated test suite (‚âà70+) and CI gating.

### Phase 6 ‚Äì Runtime Data Types & Memory Management üîÑ
- **6.1 Heap allocation (done):** Free-list allocator in runtime crate, IR/runtime hooks (`InitHeap`, `Allocate`, `FreeLocal`).
- **6.2 Strings (done/remaining):**
  - ‚úÖ Interpreter strings with escapes and helpers (`str`, `count`, `get`, `subs`).
  - ‚úÖ Compiler string literals via rodata, runtime-backed `count`/`str` (2-arg) with scoped freeing.
  - ‚úÖ Escaping strings that leave scope by cloning heap values in compiler IR and runtime `_string_clone`.
  - ‚úÖ Extend to variadic `str` and safe nested concatenation in the compiler/runtime.
  - ‚úÖ Implement `_string_get`/`_string_subs` helpers and wire compiler codegen for `get`/`subs`.
  - ‚úÖ Introduce runtime-backed coercions so compiled `str` can accept numbers/booleans/nil (mirroring interpreter conversions).
- **6.3 Lifetime improvements (in progress):**
- ‚úÖ Adopt "borrowed argument, owned return" semantics so callees receive pointers without cloning while callers stay responsible for frees.
- ‚úÖ Insert liveness-aware `FreeLocal` emission to ensure the last user of each allocation performs the release and skip `Allocate` for dead temporaries (covers straight-line and branched `let` bodies with shared liveness helpers).
- ‚úÖ Wire the shared liveness planner into other heap-owning sites (e.g., string helpers outside `let`) so redundant frees disappear across the compiler.
  - ‚úÖ Expand `tests/programs/` to exercise branch-heavy lets, unused bindings, and nested frees so the new lifetime semantics stay regression-tested.
  - ‚úÖ Prototype allocator telemetry (build flag + CLI toggle) to trace allocations/frees and validate reuse with new stress cases under `tests/programs/memory/`.
- **6.4 Composite data structures (planned):**
- ‚úÖ **6.4.1 Vector runtime primitives:** Designed a heap-backed vector layout with runtime helpers for create/access/clone/free and surfaced interpreter support for `vec`, `count`, `get`, and `subs`-style slicing, mirroring string semantics with borrowed inputs and cloned returns. Telemetry workloads (`churn_reuse`, `escaping_strings`, `mixed_sizes`) ran cleanly via `tests/programs/memory/run_allocator_telemetry.sh` with zero outstanding allocations.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.2 Compiler integration for vectors:** Extended IR/codegen to allocate vectors, lower vector literals, and emit ownership-aware frees while preserving the borrow-on-pass/clone-on-return rule; added regression programs covering element churn and cross-function passes (see `tests/programs/vectors/*`).
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.3 Map runtime groundwork:** Finalised hashing/equality semantics, designed the heap layout, surfaced interpreter APIs (`hash-map`, `assoc`, `dissoc`, `contains?`, `get`), and added targeted regression programs plus runtime tests to prove the new primitives.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.4 Compiler string equality parity:** Teach the compiled `=` path to lower string comparisons via `_string_equals` so string fixtures can graduate from interpreter-only coverage.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.5 Map compiler integration:** Extend IR/codegen to allocate maps, lower literals, and emit ownership-aware runtime calls while maintaining borrow-on-pass/clone-on-return rules; unblock integration fixtures (currently skipped) that exercise assoc/dissoc/get across functions.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.5a Map tagging parity:** Added a dedicated `TAG_MAP` in the runtime, taught assoc/dissoc/get/render and telemetry helpers to respect it, and updated the compiler/tag emitters so nested map values no longer fall back to `TAG_ANY`.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.6 Map literal syntax:** Support `{}` map literals in the parser, evaluator, and compiler, ensuring the new syntax lowers to the existing runtime helpers and respects ownership/liveness planning.
  - ‚úÖ **6.4.7 Keyword literals:** Parse `:keyword` atoms as self-evaluating values, extend interpreter/compiler map key handling with a dedicated tag, and add unit/runtime coverage so compiled maps share equality semantics with the interpreter.
  - **6.4.8 Set runtime groundwork:** Build on the map primitives to supply membership-focused helpers (`set`, `contains?`, `disj`), confirm borrowed/owned behaviour, and add interpreter fixtures that stress uniqueness and churn before compiler work begins.
  - **6.4.9 Set literal syntax:** Extend the reader/compiler to recognise `#{}` forms, lowering them onto the set runtime helpers while maintaining ownership and telemetry coverage alongside new fixtures.
  - **6.4.10 Spillover ergonomics:** Introduce destructuring helpers or higher-order utilities that lean on the new containers, and wire telemetry harnesses to capture allocator pressure under mixed workloads.
- **6.5 Type inference pass (planned):**
  - **6.5.1 Analysis scaffolding:** Build a reusable analysis pipeline over the AST/IR that iterates until stable `ValueKind` assignments emerge for locals, parameters, and returns.
  - **6.5.2 Constraint solving & propagation:** Encode primitive operations, runtime helpers, and composite data semantics as constraints; ensure borrowed/owned markers survive the pass so codegen can keep clone/free behaviour correct.
  - **6.5.3 Diagnostics & UX:** Surface actionable errors for mismatched arity/types, ambiguous branches, and unsupported coercions, with location info that plugs into existing formatter/output.
  - **6.5.4 Compiler integration:** Feed inferred kinds back into lowering (skipping redundant runtime conversions, tightening liveness frees) and gate code paths that still require fallbacks.
  - **6.5.5 Test harness:** Add focused unit tests for the solver plus integration fixtures in `tests/programs/` that cover polymorphic functions, nested lets, and composite containers introduced in 6.4.
- **6.6 Lightweight shared ownership (planned):**
  - ‚è≥ Define ownership invariants for shared heap values (ref counts, borrow semantics, decay rules) so the runtime can manage lifetimes without user intervention.
  - ‚è≥ Prototype runtime support (header layout plus `_inc_ref`/`_dec_ref` helpers) and validate it against the existing allocator.
  - ‚è≥ Teach the compiler‚Äôs liveness planner to emit reference bumps/drops alongside current `Allocate`/`FreeLocal` logic and ensure borrow-on-argument semantics still hold.
  - ‚è≥ Extend telemetry workloads and add focused `tests/programs/` fixtures that stress shared ownership, double-free protection, and long-lived captures.
  - ‚è≥ Benchmark representative programs to gauge ref counting overhead, adjust heuristics, and document guidance in `README.md` or follow-up tickets.

### Phase 7 ‚Äì I/O and System Interaction üóÇÔ∏è
- **7.1 Terminal I/O:** `print`/`println`, stderr helpers, and simple formatting.
- **7.2 File I/O:** `slurp`, `spit`, existence checks, and file metadata.
- **7.3 Module system:** `(require ...)` semantics, dependency compilation order, and optional namespaces/standard library packaging.

### Phase 8 ‚Äì Advanced Language Features üöÄ
- **8.1 Closures in compiled code:** Environment capture layout, closure call conventions, and heap-stored activation records.
  - ‚è≥ Align interpreter/JIT closure capture semantics by cloning captured values up front so compiled closures can share borrow/ownership rules.
- **8.2 Control flow:** `loop`/`recur`, pattern matching, and structured error handling (`try`/`catch`).
- **8.3 Optimisations:** Constant folding, dead code elimination, tail-call optimisation, register allocation, and selective inlining.

### Phase 9 ‚Äì Tooling & Developer Experience üß∞
- **9.1 Debugging:** Stack traces, breakpoint support in interpreter, and environment inspection commands.
- **9.2 Diagnostics:** Source locations, syntax highlighting, and typo suggestions.
- **9.3 Build system:** Multi-file projects, incremental compilation cache, release/optimised build profiles, and CLI ergonomics (e.g., `--keep-obj` flag for retaining AOT object files).

## Quality & Testing Safeguards
- Unit/integration coverage across parser, evaluator, compiler, runtime, and executable outputs.
- CircleCI workflow enforces warnings-as-errors and runs the full cargo test suite.
- Use sample programs in `tests/programs/` to validate new runtime or compiler capabilities; memory-specific cases live under `tests/programs/memory/` with `tests/programs/memory/run_allocator_telemetry.sh` capturing allocator traces.

## Working Agreements
- Prioritise interpreter implementations before porting features to the compiler.
- Update PLAN.md and documentation alongside feature work.
- Maintain idiomatic Rust (no `try`/`catch` around imports) and ensure new phases keep tests green.
