## Instructions for agents
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Functional programming principles for clarity and maintainability (immutability, pure functions where possible, higher-order functions prefered to for loops)
- Consider debugging/profiling hooks early
- Always update documentation and tests and PLAN.md with current status so that it is next session ready
- if you fail to rewrite a file, try the diff again, do not try simpler solutions or complete rewrites
- feel free to add/expand the plan as you see fit
- When implementing new features, start with interpreter mode first (easier), then add compiler support
- sample slisp programs for testing are in tests/programs/
